Hi! I am an incoming Master's student in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at [University at Buffalo](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering.html). 

Previously, I worked at HSBC Asset Management as a Senior Data Scientist. I received my Bachelor's degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur [(IITK)](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) in 2021.
